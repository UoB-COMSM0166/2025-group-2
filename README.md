## Project Report

### Introduction

- 5% ~250 words 
- Describe your game, what is based on, what makes it novel? 

### Requirements 

- 15% ~750 words
- Use case diagrams, user stories. Early stages design. Ideation process. How did you decide as a team what to develop? 

As a team, we discovered that assigning epics to our stakeholders significantly enhanced our ability to plan the next steps. For example, epics allowed us to define user stories and acceptance criteria in advance, enabling a deeper understanding of the features we needed to develop, such as the story of a user wanting to utilize a new game feature. This allows us to list out in more details all the requirements in the development of the game and note down ideas from different stakeholders' perspectives which we may or may not have missed out on if we were to approach this without using the method taught to us. 

Furthermore, by having a clear understanding of the tasks at hand, we were able to create a detailed list of the necessary actions to implement changes and meet our stakeholders' needs, such as the specific tasks required to develop the new game feature. This gives our planning a more structured approach and we're thus less likely to make potentially fatal mistakes. 

In conclusion, the requirements gathering process provided us with valuable insights on how to organize and prioritize activities to successfully fulfill the project requirements.

### Design

- 15% ~750 words 
- System architecture. Class diagrams, behavioural diagrams. 

### Implementation

- 15% ~750 words

- Describe implementation of your game, in particular highlighting the three areas of challenge in developing your game. 

### Evaluation

- 15% ~750 words

- One qualitative evaluation (your choice) 

- One quantitative evaluation (of your choice) 

- Description of how code was tested. 

### Process 

- 15% ~750 words

- Teamwork. How did you work together, what tools did you use. Did you have team roles? Reflection on how you worked together. 

### Conclusion

- 10% ~500 words

- Reflect on project as a whole. Lessons learned. Reflect on challenges. Future work. 

### Contribution Statement

- Provide a table of everyone's contribution, which may be used to weight individual grades. We expect that the contribution will be split evenly across team-members in most cases. Let us know as soon as possible if there are any issues with teamwork as soon as they are apparent. 

### Additional Marks

You can delete this section in your own repo, it's just here for information. in addition to the marks above, we will be marking you on the following two points:

- **Quality** of report writing, presentation, use of figures and visual material (5%) 
  - Please write in a clear concise manner suitable for an interested layperson. Write as if this repo was publicly available.

- **Documentation** of code (5%)

  - Is your repo clearly organised? 
  - Is code well commented throughout?
