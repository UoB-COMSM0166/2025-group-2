- list of modifications to be made to the game
- discussion of the quantitative feedbacks received today (week 8 homework)


Summary:
- to polish the game as preparation for final version
- modifications to be made will be
		- listed with priority level
		- assigned to someone
		- high priority to be done over the next 2 weeks



List of Modifications to be made below

High Priority:
1. add coin logic
2. modify game to allow multipler mode players to buy tools from shop using their own specific keyboard keys and have it appear in the correct playing container
		and also modify game to allow multiplayer mode players to play using different keys specific to each player instead of using a mouse
3. add logic to make Incidents occur randomly during game for both singleplayer and multiplayer
4. add win/lose logic for multiplayer mode (also note that singleplayer mode does not have a timer -- player can keep playing until fruit hits top of container)
		- first player to achieve the biggest size wins
		- OR  who has the highest score after time limit wins
		- OR  player who hits the top of the container first loses
5. add more size of fruit (currently only 7 sizes of fruit, a little too easy to achieve)
6. add 2 buttons (Play Again  and  Exit) after game ends and add 1 button (Exit) to the page during gameplay
		- Play Again: play again in current mode
		- Exit: go back to main menu
7. add warning message before each Incidents occur (previous code owner for each Incidents to work on their own Incidents)
8. add a notification message at the top of the game page that shows messages when player buys something from store
	- example: Player 1 has bought Rainbow Tool (Rainbow Tool is able to merge with ALL fruits)
	- example: Player 2 does not have enough coins to buy Bomb Tool (Bomb Tool creates an explosion to remove fruits)


Medium Priority:
1. add tutorial for players to learn how to play the game when they start the game
		- singleplayer mode: an interactive step by step guide on what pressing each button will do when they start the game
		- multiplayer mode: an interactive step by step guide on how to use the shop
		- also add in the keys for each player to navigate the game (refer to /ReportMaterial/ProgressTracker/4Mar2025-multiplayer-drawing)
2. add Game Over animation
3. finalise the game name
4. modify and update the Fog Incident to make it more realistic (look at the resources that Doris sent)


Low Priority (to do if we still have time, or potentially develop as version 2 after project submission):
1. add in highest score achieved for singleplayer mode for each game session (clears after user exits the game entirely)
2. add merge visual effect and merge combo visual effect
3. modify the random Incident logic in multiplayer mode so that Incidents do NOT occur unless players buy the Incidents to disrupt opponents from shop
4. add sound effect for merge and merge combo
5. add visual animations for each tool/Incident
7. change face of the "fruits" to make it smile at us instead (make it friendly)
