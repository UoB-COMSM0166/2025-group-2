#21st Jan 2025  

- game ideas consolidation and finalisation  
- details of game ideas are found on "Week 0" tab of the "Group-2 planning" project  

Game Ideas:  
1. Flappy Mad Bird - Nightmare Edition (Gerald)  
2. Chess with Steroids (Gerald)  
3. Angry Birds (Jimmy)  
4. Breakout (Octave)  
5. Catch a Falling Star (Fan Fan)  
6. Platformer Explosion Chaos (Hayley)  
7. Bomberman (Hayley)  
8. Merge Fruit (Doris)  


Discussion timeline:  
- Two options: easy game + difficult challenge? or difficult game + easy challenge  
    --> team decision to go with easy game + difficult challenge   
- leftover ideas to pick from for easy game + difficult challenge:  
    1. Flappy Mad Bird - Nightmare Edition  
    2. Angry Birds  
    3. Breakout  
    4. Catch a Falling Star  
    5. Merge Fruit  
- team decided to pick 2 games from the above for consideration:  
    1. Merge Fruit   
        --> newest game in the list, therefore has less versions available and so more unused ideas for challenges  
    2. Flappy Mad Bird - Nightmare Edition  
        --> an old classic, which will pose an interesting challenge to think of more ideas to modify the game that doesn't already exist
