- selecting final idea  
- finalising challenges to be used for final idea  
- brainstorming on what we envision for the game itself  

Final idea chosen:  Merge Fruit (name TBC)  
Reason:  Our group prefers to go with a game that has lesser versions online so that we can have more options when modifying the game and still be novel.


Brainstorming keypoints:  
- Player will be able to choose between Single Player Mode or Multiplayer Mode 
- Single Player Mode allows for 2 gameplay options
    a. Casual Mode
    b. Time-limit Mission Mode (name TBC)
- Multiplayer Mode only allows for
    a. Time-limit Mission Mode (name TBC)
- Casual Mode will contain the following features:
    1. Voice Control option as part of gameplay. Potential ideas for what the Voice Control option does includes
        -> Voice Control activation will allow players to "shout" in varying levels of loudness to "bounce" a selected fruit back up (how loud to shout depends on size of fruit). 
           This essentially allow for a redo for that fruit.  
           Also allow players to swap around around 3 fruits to decide which fruits they want to drop first.  
           This Voice Control Redo option will be limited to a certain number of times per game.  
        -> Voice Control activation will allow players to select a fruit and "shout" to cause the fruit to explode.    
           Players get extra points for fruits exploded. 
           This Voice Control Explosion will be limited to a certain number of times per game.  
    2. Special Rainbow Fruit that is able to merge with any types of fruit. The number of times this fruit appears per game is random, but will never exceed a certain number of times.  
    3. Consecutive merges gives higher scores  
    4. Top 10 local scores will be displayed  (limited to Single Player Mode only)  
- Time-limit Mission Mode is the same between Single Player Mode and Multiplayer Mode. It will build on top of whatever is found in Casual Mode and also include:  
    1. Each game starts with a time limit of 3 minutes and players have to complete x number of missions within the time limit  
    2. Additional Special Fruits with special effects will be included like:  
        -> fruit that when merged will add extra x seconds to time limit  
        -> fruit that when merged will deduct x seconds from current time left  
        -> fruit that when merged will explode. Any fruits within a certain distance from the centre of the exploded fruit will also explode together. Extra points given for exploded fruits.  
        -> (optional) fruit that when merged will cause random fruits to switch places


Key Challenges:  
- adding Voice Control elements  
- implementation of Multiplayer Mode  


Week 3 homework - Introduction of game:  
Merge fruit is a game where the user drops fruits into a container to merge them with the same type, gaining points for each merge completed.  
Each merge will result in a larger fruit, taking up more space in the container and thus increasing the difficulty in merging and progressing onto higher scores.  
Our group intends to modify this game by including 2 main challenges: adding voice control and multiplayer mode.  
Other additional twists to the game include additional fruits with special properties and an additional game mode where players have to complete a fixed number of missions within a time limit.
