- discussion on Class Diagram/Sequence Diagram
- discussion of current functions created for demo 1 of the game
- discussion of UI of demo 1 of the game


Class Diagram:
- we might need to refactor the codes and add in a UI script for creating the walls and shop etc to be used in both single and player mode
- to be added: 
    1. additional class for incidence on the same level as the fruit, shop and timer
    2. individual functions in shop to be added below shopitem as each special fruit and each special tool

Sequence Diagram:
- to be done after we complete the first demo of the game


Summary points after discussing the current functions creataed for demo 1 of game:
- we will need to fix the issue of the current fruit dropping when we click on anywhere in the game to activate the special functions
- need to fix a top wall to contain all fruits within the container so fruits don't fly out of container (game should end if fruits go over top line)
    - currently, if we use the "shuffle" function, the fruit might fly out of the container and land outside the container and we want to stop this
- we need to add in the functionality where the game will end if the fruit goes over the top red line 
- to create another class for randomFruit so that it appears as part of the Mystery Box function (currently we only have a randomTool for tools)
- we need to add the tools and fruits to the shop
- we need to change the codes so that the size of the game containers will be relative to the screen size 
    - currently size of everything in the UI is hard coded and doesn't resize itself based on the size of the user's screen
- create function to assign scores for each merge in main game 
- add global timer to the game so it lasts for 2 minutes per game 
- add more incidences (only have the wind incidence right now)
    - change the "Earthquake" incidence the "Fog" incidence where the user loses some visibility of the playing field
