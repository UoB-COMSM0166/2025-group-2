Summary:
- We can add a shop store, special fruits and timer in to the game during reading week 
- Discuss later which special fruits are going to be in the multiplayer mode
- Discussing the container size  multiplayer, because it also modifies the gameplay of multiplayer mode.
- Discussing the fact that too many colors of fruits would make the gameplay a mess
-the concept of 'tool' appear.
- Each of us selected 2 fruits/tools to discuss which are going to go in the version 1.0, we got 12 ideas, then discuss and define the first 6 fruits/tools selected
- Incident.- is going to be set randomly at the beginning of the game, and is going to occur randomly during all the game.
- We decided to go for two containers for the multiplayer mode with just 5 types of fruits.
- For the UI, we are going to follow Fan's design proposal (see kanban).


Final Special Fruits list:


----------------You can buy it multiple times----------------------
Once you buy the special fruit,the fruit you have in hand is going to be changed to the special fruit

- Rainbow fruit	- Once you buy it, you can drop it into the container and it will merge with the FISRT fruit it collides with (it can merge with ANY fruit types)
		- has a different design/colour to it compared to the other fruits

- Bomb fruit	- The range of explosion depends on the biggest fruits' diameter. Doesn't need merge. Instant explosion once it collides with the first fruit


Once the user buys the tool, they get the effect immediately (tool effect lasts for 1 use)

- Mystery box	- Tool, You can get any of the current special fruits/tools.
- Double Score	- Tool, Double score for 10 seconds.
- Shuffle	- Tool, Changing all fruits positions randomly (just fruits in the playing field). 
- Divine shield	- Tool, Protect from incidents for 30 seconds.



Temporary Random incidents:

1-Gale - Affect the trajectory of the dropping fruits
2-Earthquake - Randomly change the location of the fruits on the board
3-Freeze - Randomly make some of the fruits on the board can't be merged
