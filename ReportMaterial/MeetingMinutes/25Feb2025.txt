- re-assessing priority of tasks -- prioritize multiplayer over other functions of game
- re-alignment on some smaller details of the different tools of the game etc
- discussion of the user feedbacks received today (week 7 homework)


Summary and to-do:
- moving forward, we will push changes to the "dev" branch instead of the "main" branch
- no more special fruits, will all become tools instead where the special effects will occur straight away
    - rename Rainbow Fruit to Rainbow Tool, Bomb Fruit to Bomb
    - Bomb codes to be modified so bomb is a fixed size instead of fruits becoming bombs 
    - Bomb codes to be modified so bomb explosion occurs when it collides with fruits in container, not requiring explosion
    - modify the GameManager.js or wherever the handleMerge function exists in to handle bomb merge
    - modify ToolManage's createSpecialFruit(FruitClass) to make sure the bomb fruit is a fixed size 
- Bomb Tool and Rainbow Tool to be modified to make their effects useable after pressing the buttons created 
    - some codes were modified on the backend which broke the logic a little, so some modifications have to be made
- tools like Rainbow Tool and Bomb Tool to change the fruit on hand immediately after purchasing from shop
- Rainbow Tool codes to be modified
    - currently the merge function for Rainbow Tool is located in GameManager -- need to move it into RainbowFruit.js
    - fix the Rainbow Tool codes overall to make it work 
- fruits will change to maximum of 7 sizes
- fruits that can appear on the hand to be dropped will be limited to the first 4 sizes only
- activation of Divine Shield will not stop the movement of time of the incident
    - for example, the incident will last for 30 seconds. The Divine Shield lasts for 20 seconds. 
      In this example, we buy the Divine Shield right when the incident starts. 
      By the time  the Divine Shield ends, the incident will have 10 seconds left.
      Because right now, activation of Divine Shield stops the time movement of the incident, 
      so in the above case, the incident still has 30 seconds left after the Divine Shield ends.
- add multiplayer mode to the game
- add start menu
