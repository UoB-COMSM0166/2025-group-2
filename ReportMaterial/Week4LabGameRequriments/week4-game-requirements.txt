Epics and User Stories for Stakeholders:  

1. Users (Octave)
Epic 1 - Time Challenge Game Mode
User Story 1 - As a player, I want to play a timed challenge mode where I must merge as many fruits as possible within a limited time ao that I can test my speed and skills while earning special rewards
