Think Aloud Evaluation 1 - 3Mar2025

- good twist with the random incidents
- seems like there are bugs when more than 1 incidents occur at the same time
- will be good to get rid of thee bugs for multiple random incidences
- bomb and fruit tool makes game easier 
- might want to limit the number of times players can buy the tools like bomb and rainbow, maybe using currency or money?
