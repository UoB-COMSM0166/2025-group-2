Think Aloud Evaluation 1 - 25Feb2025

- shake tool is interesting and adds playability
- having all the additional functions and tools is a fun and addicting twist
- rainbow function stops working sometimes?
- bomb fruit merges, although i thought it would explode from the name
- will be good to have a description of the functions and tools
- the eye movement of the balls are interesting
- might be better to show all available sizes of the balls
- playing field is a little small
